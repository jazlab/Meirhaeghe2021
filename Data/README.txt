This folder contains processed data from two experiments:

- reproduction task (see also Sohn, Narain, Meirhaeghe et al. 2019) 
First, unzip G_2prior_ReadyM200ms-Set_bin20ms_bootstrap.zip and H_2prior_ReadyM200ms-Set_bin20ms_bootstrap.zip to create .mat file. G_2prior_ReadyM200ms-Set_bin20ms_bootstrap and H_2prior_ReadyM200ms-Set_bin20ms_bootstrap contain trial-averaged bootstrapped PSTHs (bin=20ms, Gaussian kernel SD=40ms, Nbootstrap=100) between Ready-200ms and Set (measurement epoch). The data is separated by condition. There are 8 conditions in total: Short versus Long, Left versus Right (location of the visual target relative to fixation), Hand versus Eye (modality of response). Each PSTH datafile consists of a 3D tensor (time x neuron x bootstrap). Within each condition, activity for different time intervals were averaged with attrition (that is, to compute the firing rate in bin N, we used all trials for which the Set cue has not happened yet, see Methods of Sohn et al. 2019 for more details). Each file also contains condition-specific behavioral data, for users who may want to explore further the relationship between behavior and neural features. There are three behavioral variables made available here: ts (sample interval), tp (production interval) and trial nb. The data is given on a trial-by-trial basis and organized by behavioral sessions (17 for monkey H, 12 for monkey G).      

- gain task (see also Remington et al. 2018)
C_gain_Ready-Set_bin20ms_bootstrap and J_gain_Ready-Set_bin20ms_bootstrap contain trial-averaged bootstrapped PSTHs (bin=20ms, Gaussian kernel SD=40ms, Nbootstrap=100) between Ready and Set. The data is formatted as for the reproduction task: conditions (gain 1 versus gain 1.5) are separated and PSTH datafiles consist of 3D tensors (time x neuron x bootstrap).
